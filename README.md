# data-distribution
For calculating the mean, median and mode for unimodal data from the input list. Then compare the mean, median and mode to get the shape of the unimodal data distribution. The output (shape of distribution) can be "Symmetric Distribution", "Left-skewed Distribution" or "Right-skewed Distribubtion". Note that the input data should be unimodal and the list can't be empty.
